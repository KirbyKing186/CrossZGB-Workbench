# Medamayaki
Version 1.0.0

## Description
A platformer project inspired by "Palm Tree Paradise" of Wario Land 4. This project demonstrates the following features:
- Platformer framework with custom animations and custom velocity
- Subpixel movement and acceleration
- Advanced platformer collision, such as slopes and platforms
- Customizable camera controls and offsets
- Dynamic background scroll buffer stored in SRAM, allowing reads/writes of background tiles
- Color gradient utilizing LCD interrupts

## Compatibility
The project works best on CGB.
The project is compatible with DMG systems, but faces lag. The project also does not have monochrome-specific assets.
Other platforms have not been tested.
